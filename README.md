# PromptShifter
Simple prompt shifter webapp

To iterate between prompts I thought of this simple editor. It allows you to quickly shift the order, select a prompt part and use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the buttons to shift the part up or down. Also you can apply weights to different parts in a very easy way.

Howto:
- Paste or type a prompt in  the input field and press [enter]
- Adjust the sequence of the prompts using the [up] or [down] keys or buttons
- Toggle weights of the parts using the [t] button or the toggle button
- Increase weight using the [=] key and decrease using the [-] key or buttons

Hope it is usefull to you!
