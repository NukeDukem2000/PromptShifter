# PromptShifter
Simple prompt shifter webapp

To iterate between prompts I thought of this simple editor. It allows you to quickly shift the order, select a prompt part and use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the buttons to shift the part up or down. Also you can apply weights to different parts in a very easy way.

Hope it is usefull to you!
